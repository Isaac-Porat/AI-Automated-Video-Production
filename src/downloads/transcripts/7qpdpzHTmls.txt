325.08 | new we have a lot of
327.44 | customers yeah I think you should add on
329.84 | this voice know that it's very important
331.639 | we just know very transparent what the
333.88 | prices are because then we can just move
336.639 | mountains you
347.8 | know Vince what advice do you give your
350.16 | younger
355.96 | self what the
358.479 | hell
360.319 | don't yeah like they advise the youself
363.12 | don't build your team on
365.68 | Pipeline you got to build it up a little
368.0 | bit bro it's
369.479 | got you to warm him up a little bit bro
372.759 | he's ready for it of course just put a
374.88 | camera on me and I'm ready to spit some
376.68 | B you know anyway advice to my younger
378.96 | self is just start quicker and don't uh
382.0 | hesitate too much you know you'll find
384.56 | you'll find your success along the way
386.12 | not in the beginning and the grass is
388.199 | green on the other side don't believe
389.599 | don't look up to others just focus on
391.08 | your own thought don't don't compare
393.24 | your chapter one to somebody else
394.68 | chapter 20 I think my advice would
396.8 | really be to just uh I think I I
399.88 | honestly think it all comes down to
401.52 | believing if you believe it's possible
404.56 | that's when you can make it
416.319 | happen
418.4 | oh
428.16 | car but I need to pay with Apple pay in
430.24 | apple not not with we pay no we I need
434.319 | Apple pay how does the Apple Store not
436.599 | have apple yeah that will be a
439.24 | shame it will be bad for The
441.639 | Branding if I have to pay with the
443.44 | competitive payment I can use Google
445.28 | Play here
448.319 | no
454.039 | so what Vince and I are currently
456.039 | working on is something that we've been
457.52 | chatting about for months now um and
459.919 | that is essentially disrupting the
462.4 | entire supply chain Niche within the
466.199 | world so when we talk about diet to
468.08 | Consumer Brands and the way they
470.52 | interact with China um also in line with
473.36 | my story obviously growing up on this
475.56 | side of the world speaking the language
477.28 | in combination with the knowledge that
479.479 | and the network that comes through Vince
481.159 | around director consumer brand like
484.199 | being a director consumer brand owner
485.84 | himself um we're really trying to do
489.0 | something that no one is first of all
490.879 | able to do and also no one is doing it
493.759 | because it's it's just not been done
495.36 | before just like we we can close the the
498.52 | gap on a lot of things so for brands
501.36 | that areally like for example targeting
503.52 | worldwide International because we see a
505.319 | lot of brands for example me myself
507.52 | started for example in the Netherlands
508.919 | now expanding worldwide so why would we
511.68 | ship all International orders from the
513.2 | Netherlands while we have to
515.039 | consistently work on getting fried from
517.599 | China to to the Dutch Warehouse with
520.24 | both and it's not it's not workable to
523.519 | just keep on buying stuff with both
525.32 | because we are scaling and when you're
526.68 | scaling hot you need to send it with air
528.64 | and I don't know if they know but
531.04 | sending it by air consistently is eating
533.32 | up your margins and not only your
534.839 | margins but also the time that it takes
536.76 | to get it from the Chinese Warehouse
538.36 | back to your Chinese Dutch Warehouse
540.6 | it's just not helping when you're
541.959 | scaling when you want to do a higher
543.48 | Revenue you cannot consistently have no
546.16 | stock low stock or some of the
547.72 | collections out of
549.16 | stock have the warehouse in China
552.2 | receive your stock in half a day if it
554.88 | in a morning the the stock is prepared
556.88 | by the factory they just ship it
558.399 | straight from the factory to the Chinese
560.2 | Warehouse with now the shipping partners
562.48 | that we collabing with just can deliver
564.76 | it in in 5 to 8 days and when the
566.88 | expectations meet their requirements
570.32 | then I don't see any negatives of it
572.48 | only positive especially when you want
574.16 | to scale your store because it will help
576.16 | you much more with everything and that's
578.839 | basically the supply chain to answer
580.279 | your question supply chain is the part
582.12 | of the back end to deliver it to the
584.44 | front end so when a customer buys what
586.8 | happens when a customer press that buy
588.56 | button what's going in place that is the
591.399 | whole supply chain that we making a
592.8 | solution to let the people scale hard
594.399 | you
597.399 | know uh
600.519 | let's kch
602.56 | ketchup ketchup ketchup
605.6 | ketchup

870.44 | massive trend for Brands to start going
873.639 | global and fulfill from China and this
875.759 | is uh the warehouse that we have been
879.6 | working with uh for quite a while
892.04 | now integration into their system
894.639 | because we are the same as them but we
896.92 | are also China so what we do you just
899.199 | bridged the Gap so perfectly meeting the
901.279 | people behind the screen that are
902.8 | responsible for all the products you sh
904.92 | yeah it's good man it's funny especially
906.839 | Ellen that guy bro he's like literally
909.12 | 24/7 he's my account manager I I ping

939.8 | guine good trip it's super cool to see
943.04 | how um as I said I try to say this in
946.079 | the factory as well but I don't think I
947.36 | finished the the story properly but it's
949.16 | really cool to
950.24 | see how you know someone that's been in
952.92 | the D to Consumer space for a long time
955.92 | to finally see how many people they
957.8 | actually put to work with their business
959.68 | and even though for a lot of guys it's
961.44 | it's a Shopify notification on their
963.519 | phone um but indirectly you're employing
966.079 | hundreds of people especially if you're
967.519 | doing volume like this guy does crazy
970.759 | how much people like uh I also FaceTime
973.36 | with my brother Nick and I was he was
975.6 | just in his in the office in Amsterdam
978.16 | and I I told him listen bro you think
980.36 | that the only people we are apping are
981.959 | sitting with you in the office bro but
983.44 | have a look at this I filmed the factory
986.0 | where like literally 50 people were
987.839 | packing pitching making sure the
990.079 | branding the everything is proper the
992.6 | from the from the packaging to the seal
995.16 | everything you know I see a whole floor
998.079 | of people working on our products with
1000.44 | our stock I was filming my brother could
1003.16 | not believe his eyes you know because
1004.959 | he's he's not in that China he's in
1007.959 | Amsterdam just seeing Shopify analytics
1010.639 | and of course he he knows that we move
1012.639 | product and that we move weight but
1015.519 | seeing it like coming together here in
1017.72 | effectively Factory floor is literally
1019.68 | crazy man really crazy because they were
1022.519 | preparing a a stock batch to be sent to
1025.0 | our warehouse here in China and uh it
1028.6 | was just stack to the roof man it was
1031.0 | like holy hell are we moving this type
1033.039 | of weight and like I see sometimes
1035.36 | pictures and stuff but now here seeing
1037.24 | everything on the floor and also these
1039.16 | guys telling us that they are having
1041.0 | like two floors of people working just
1042.72 | for us it's crazy man really crazy yeah
1045.559 | it was a good trip it's nice trying it
1048.559 | can be draining but it's always uh it is
1051.039 | draining man but
1054.16 | yeah
