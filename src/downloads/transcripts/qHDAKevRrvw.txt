0.08 | Mike chebet is on a mission to build the
1.8 | next trillion dollar tech company and
4.0 | this isn't just some marketing hype
6.0 | every single person at his company
7.6 | really believes it like literally every
9.559 | single person from uh an EA all the way
11.559 | up to the CEO if you ask how much is the
12.759 | company going be worth to say trillion
14.0 | dollar TR du trillion dollar company
15.879 | which sounds insane until you're like oh
17.24 | wait a second these people actually
18.52 | believe this like we don't shy away from
20.32 | saying that we were going to be bigger
21.76 | than Microsoft or Amazon like everyone
23.56 | in this room will not stop until that's
25.519 | that's reality but instead of going
27.359 | after something flashy like humanoid
29.0 | robots mik is making his trillion dollar
31.359 | bet against Automation and his company
34.32 | will actually create more jobs for
36.32 | American workers our mission is to
38.0 | empower both businesses and workers to
39.64 | resar full productivity and potential
41.64 | this company is called tra and even
43.28 | though startups are dying left and right
45.12 | throughout Silicon Valley right now
46.92 | Mike's company is growing insanely fast
49.399 | and has already raised over $43 million
51.68 | in funding in Just 2 years but how did
53.96 | he build this so quickly and could it
56.079 | really be the next trillion dollar
57.52 | company well I sat down with Mike and
59.399 | his team and learned that there are
60.84 | three key strategies that could make
62.8 | tra's trillion dollar bet a
66.33 | [Music]
67.96 | winner I'm Mike chevit and I'm the CEO
70.439 | of tra to understand tra you first need
72.96 | to understand Mike's early days in Tech
75.4 | he grew up just outside Washington DC
77.64 | went to college at the University of
79.04 | Virginia to study economics and quickly
81.04 | found himself on a traditional Finance
82.799 | track Goldman Sachs Investment Banking
84.64 | was the most prestigious job on Wall
86.2 | Street for new grads but they weren't
87.96 | hiring at his college so he had to
89.92 | hustle and cold email his way into an
91.68 | internship I just wrote a bunch of
93.88 | essays and things like that on to to
96.36 | submit to all these investment Banks and
98.52 | then I ended up getting the Goldman soch
99.88 | internship the plan worked but after a
101.56 | few years working in finance he realized
103.72 | he wanted to get his hands dirty in a
105.439 | real business instead of just shuffling
107.159 | spreadsheets for the rest of his life it
109.0 | wasn't very intellectually stimulating
111.0 | because hedge funds are not that
112.24 | complicated from an operational
113.479 | standpoint so he joined a company you've
115.479 | probably never heard of McMaster Car
117.88 | which if you look them up online it
119.439 | looks boring it's like a bunch of screws
122.2 | it's a bunch of bolts and hammers that
123.84 | you buy so they reach out hey we have a
126.119 | management rotation program we'd love to
127.84 | get to know you even though they don't
129.56 | have a consumer brand their parts power
132.319 | a huge portion of the American economy
134.28 | basx was a big customer of ours in La so
137.4 | when SpaceX would have to build a
138.959 | massive rocket they would be like let's
141.04 | order a bunch of product from McMaster
143.28 | Car the engineering supplier it was at
145.28 | McMaster Car where Mike first came into
147.48 | contact with the light Industrial
148.879 | Staffing industry he would go on to try
150.68 | and disrupt years later I know it sounds
153.239 | boring but this experience would lay the
155.519 | foundation of tra so part of my job with
158.4 | with trying to manage that was of course
160.76 | you want to manage your your team in the
162.28 | warehouse but you also start relying on
164.28 | Staffing so this that's how I discovered
166.28 | the Staffing industry anytime the
168.159 | company needed to ship out parts to a
169.76 | customer Mike would have to call a bunch
171.879 | of temporary staffing firms to try and
174.0 | get them to send out workers to help
175.72 | pack boxes and fulfill orders it was a
177.76 | timeconsuming laborious process that
179.76 | that was full of inefficiencies so then
182.12 | that's when I felt the pain point so
183.68 | that less than half the people show up
185.519 | because the Staffing industry is an
187.28 | archaic industry that is spoiled by the
190.159 | business critical need that you're
191.48 | solving because I don't have another an
196.08 | option Mike learned a lot at McMaster
198.599 | car but he still wanted to move faster
200.84 | so he joined Uber and quickly earned a
202.959 | reputation for his insane work ethic and
205.0 | ability to get things done his managers
206.799 | noticed and Mike was quickly tasked with
208.68 | the job of launching Uber eats into new
210.439 | markets I got the job at Uber Uber was
213.04 | just about to launch Uber Eats so Uber
215.04 | Eats had not existed it was a small
216.68 | incubation in Los Angeles and Toronto
218.92 | his story of how Uber launches new
220.599 | markets is fascinating and it really
222.48 | illustrates how young people can move
224.12 | mountains when they have the autonomy to
226.159 | execute quickly so basically I was
228.76 | responsible for launching Rio de Janeiro
230.519 | in Brazil so essentially what an Uber
233.239 | launch looks like as you fly into the
235.84 | market we have some idea what worked in
238.28 | previous markets so so you have to build
240.319 | out a sales team from scratch so you
242.2 | drop into a market you hire a bunch of
244.319 | people that are interested in sales you
246.48 | build a lead list and then you have a
248.439 | bunch of sales reps Clos a bunch of
250.519 | restaurants then you start building out
252.599 | your driver Supply so your Courier
254.439 | Supply so now you have your drivers and
256.6 | your couriers now you have to do like a
258.16 | huge marketing stun for your eaters so
260.479 | for Brazil we did free beer on Uber eat
262.8 | and we literally went from being like
264.919 | out of the top 100 on the App Store
266.759 | because we were president in Sal Paulo
268.24 | to number one in the app store and we
270.16 | broke everything but like I got the
271.919 | opportunity to scale that to 16
273.56 | different countries so I got to see time
275.4 | and time again like what works and what
277.919 | goes in when building a Marketplace
279.6 | product at a three-sided Marketplace
281.44 | Uber Eats is harder than than like a
283.0 | two-sided Marketplace so with McMaster
285.16 | Car Mike had seen the timeconsuming
286.84 | inefficiencies with temp Staffing and at
289.32 | Uber Mike had learned how to solve the
291.6 | chicken and egg problem involved in
293.44 | launching a new Marketplace it was only
295.44 | logical that he would put these two
297.199 | skills together and start a company but
299.08 | it was also the the perfect time for
300.32 | this since America's supply chain was
302.24 | about to go through massive upheaval the
304.12 | pandemic has turned economies upside
306.44 | down the National Labor shortage plays a
308.759 | role in the supply chain challenges in
310.639 | the time of Co 19 that's helping to
312.72 | drive this whole Workforce shortage
314.52 | across all Industries where did all the
317.039 | workers go basically I was at at Uber I
321.479 | knew I wanted to start something of my
323.199 | own but during Co I actually saw how a
326.36 | lot of things were fundamentally
327.479 | changing and there was a massive labor
329.8 | shortage I had kept thinking about this
332.16 | problem in which case a lot of things
333.84 | had changed and like the essential
335.36 | worker was essentially like front center
338.16 | and everyone was actually putting on
340.08 | those masks and going to the
340.919 | distribution centers to make sure that
342.639 | the world still had food on the table
344.319 | and to make sure that everyone still had
345.56 | masks so I I just got super deep on it I
351.24 | like went online tried all the different
352.8 | competitor platforms none of them
354.199 | actually solved the problem um none of
356.44 | them catered anything to the business
358.199 | side the idea was simple build an Uber
360.28 | eat style gig Marketplace that would
362.24 | connect workers with open shifts at
364.08 | distribution centers and event venues
365.88 | old school staffing agencies have been
367.56 | trying to solve this problem for decades
369.759 | but the industry is still massively
371.16 | inefficient so the way a traditional
373.12 | Staff Agency runs is they have an office
375.12 | and they have a t sales operation and
376.759 | when you submit a request for 20 workers
379.199 | they're actually calling a bunch of
380.52 | workers to be like would you be willing
382.08 | to work at McMaster Car um they also
384.639 | have actual like offices so you have to
386.68 | run an office a telephone Bank you have
388.319 | all these people making phone calls
389.639 | people will literally just sit there
391.28 | waiting to get called to be like hey we
393.199 | need 20 people to go sit in this van so
395.199 | now there's more stuff well the most
396.84 | important thing that's broken into the
398.0 | light Industrial Staffing or basically
399.44 | any temporary staffing industry is
400.72 | what's known as a fill rate which
402.199 | basically is about 45 to 50% which
404.4 | basically means if you request head
405.56 | workers you get five you can't fill the
407.8 | shifts it takes too long the quality of
410.44 | workers are terrible in addition there's
412.759 | also uh a long lead time so you
415.08 | basically have to submit a request for
416.639 | hourly staff at workers traditionally
418.24 | before trial at least a week in advance
420.44 | so God forbid you have variable demand
422.599 | in the last week there's nothing you can
424.199 | do Staffing is the current solution to a
428.44 | a very severe problem of the fact that
430.599 | your labor which is your number one like
433.8 | like your number one cost is not able to
437.24 | like Flex up and flex down with your
438.8 | business and everybody who uses hourly
441.199 | wage workers just accepts that as
442.84 | acceptable and this is the first key
445.12 | strategy Mike is using targeting a niche
447.759 | market that can expand massively over
449.879 | time tra started as a light Industrial
452.36 | Staffing Company serving Miami that
454.52 | sounds ridiculously Niche but as you'll
456.879 | see starting small is actually the best
459.479 | way to attack the massive Global labor
461.56 | market the Staffing industry is a huge
464.039 | industry it's 520 billion dollars on a
466.36 | global basis but it's but it just
468.599 | doesn't work and so if worker you know
471.159 | variable labor makes sense the fixed
473.199 | cost of holding people on staff when you
474.72 | have variable demand makes no economic
476.56 | sense the only reason it exists is
478.08 | because people actually needed to run
480.159 | their businesses Mike knew there was a
482.039 | big opportunity here but he had a bunch
484.039 | of obstacles in his way he'd need
486.199 | workers to download the app he'd need
488.44 | companies to agree to hire workers on
490.24 | tra and he'd also need a technical
492.44 | co-founder to help him build
495.199 | it the first step for him was not
497.28 | raising Capital was to recruit an
498.639 | appropriate co-founder and he had some
500.28 | ideas about how to go find one was sort
502.28 | of pseudo interviewing people so he
503.879 | joined an accelerator program called on
505.639 | De in 2020 and met ache buiga yeah so
508.68 | I'm a the co- Conor and CTO ER at Tron a
511.68 | Stanford engineer with years of
513.12 | experience at high growth tech companies
515.32 | uh and I remember the weekend before the
518.08 | program I'm sitting on my girlfriend on
520.919 | my fiance's couch and I was scrolling
523.24 | through these these bios and reading
525.08 | them and I I I get to Mike's and I'm
528.399 | reading it obviously is a very
529.92 | impressive bio and my uh my girlfriend
532.76 | is reading over my shoulder she's like
534.48 | this guy's a winner you should
535.92 | definitely talk to him um and then that
539.44 | that uh that weekend like the next day
542.24 | they had our the first like onboarding
544.12 | sessions and all those things and so one
546.04 | of those breakout roomors I was in the
547.279 | room with Mike as well I do think it's
549.72 | like a gift from God that I met hche
551.56 | like I I genuinely and like I had met a
554.8 | lot of people like he was by far the
557.04 | most impressive that I had met and so we
559.8 | started talking he started telling uh
561.959 | telling me more about the idea for tra
564.0 | so I knew that I had to like sell him on
566.519 | the vision I was like this is where
567.72 | we're going to go this is like why we're
569.32 | going to win in this Spas we really
572.12 | headed off immediately really clicked
574.12 | and I was really excited about what he
575.72 | was starting to work on with uh with the
577.8 | idea for tra with oay on board he could
579.92 | now build the tech but Mike also wanted
582.2 | to scale tra as quickly as possible so
584.6 | Mike needed VC funding so we reached out
587.0 | to my colleague Keith R boy at Founders
588.76 | fund to meet up and discuss the business
591.32 | I actually didn't know much about
592.44 | Venture Capital so despite being in
594.68 | finance before I found an air table that
597.399 | had a bunch of investors that were in
598.68 | the Miami region where I was I was
600.68 | living and he was one of them I believe
603.24 | Mike read about it Mike was already
604.64 | living in Lami and sent me a LinkedIn
606.36 | message so I said hey Keith I'm like
609.04 | working at Uber but I'm building
610.6 | something big would love to chat so I
613.16 | scanned his profile which had a several
615.36 | impressive uh ingredients we went to
617.12 | coffee across the street and he told me
618.959 | about uh like more about what he do
621.68 | that's how I initially met him he sort
623.519 | of actually refused to tell me about tra
626.279 | uh for months after we became friends
628.24 | cuz Keith actually the time I had not
629.72 | really pitched him but but he knew I was
631.72 | working on it he wanted to be perfect
634.64 | and you know he wanted to have
636.0 | everything like perfectly aligned and
637.92 | then one day we're having coffee and he
639.68 | has his laptop and he was willing to
641.12 | show me like the first time like a draft
642.839 | him a deck uh it was actually really
644.76 | really really impressive uh so it
646.2 | immediately clicks with me that it was
647.44 | both a good idea and that he was very
648.68 | well suited to do this I ended up
650.56 | meeting Keith as well that time so Mike
652.839 | and had met Keith I think a couple
654.36 | months before that o was working with me
656.48 | in Miami we went to uh dinner with ke
659.6 | Mike wanted to make sure that he had the
661.2 | right co-founder so he he he scheduled a
663.76 | joint dinner for me to sort of pseudo
665.56 | interview and uh check the matchmaking
667.72 | Keith had heard the stories about OE at
670.72 | the spelling being and uh halfway
672.92 | through the dinner uh a told me a story
675.76 | a had competed in one of these like
677.76 | spelling be kind of things National
679.279 | Championship kind of thing junior year I
680.72 | believe he finished third and kind of
682.6 | like sort of kind of Choke to serve a
684.72 | thir uh but then instead of giving up he
687.32 | went back in next year to win as soon as
689.24 | he told me the story that he went back
690.519 | to next year to win I was like this is
692.68 | perfect for Mike moment oxy came on
694.639 | board we like refined some materials he
696.639 | worked with the a design agency to just
698.36 | like clean it up a bit I was in San
699.92 | Francisco at the time so I flew out to
701.639 | to Miami and I was like okay I'm going
703.48 | to work with Mike in person for like the
705.32 | next week um and so we did a like
707.36 | basically a hackathon weekend together
709.24 | we just worked together for a for a
712.04 | while we went and talked to customers we
713.68 | built like we were in my apartment like
716.079 | in in my bedroom actually like I'm not
718.279 | an engineer so I did I did a no code
720.079 | product and he did actually coding kind
721.88 | of solidified like there's there's
723.48 | something here that's a building like we
725.12 | need to to to double down here so as
728.04 | soon as I saw about the industry what
729.839 | was broken how large it was and then he
732.16 | had ideas about how to fix it I was
734.76 | already impressed already you know sort
736.36 | of willing to invest and so ended up uh
739.6 | ended up closing an amazing seed round
741.88 | over the next like week or so with uh
744.36 | with founder son and general Catalyst uh
746.6 | leading that round we had participated
748.16 | in Fr Village and from Lux capital I put
751.04 | in my two weeks at Uber and like I was
752.839 | ready to build with money in the bank
754.48 | and a solid co-founding team in place
756.48 | the team started building the first
760.68 | product immediately got to building so
763.399 | like essentially like the the scene
765.12 | check hit in like August so two years
767.279 | ago now and then in that case I
768.959 | immediately hit up Louise who is our
770.839 | first operations employee and he worked
772.839 | with me in Mexico with Uber from his
774.959 | time at Uber Eats Mike knew that
776.76 | building a Marketplace business would be
778.36 | very tricky trick you need to match the
780.079 | supply side with the demand side
782.04 | perfectly or one half of your users will
784.32 | be disappointed demand side is the
786.68 | customers so business customers uh they
789.279 | are the demand side workers are
791.199 | essentially the supply side uh that
792.88 | we're now matching to the demand based
794.959 | on you know their criteria Mike's team
797.0 | needed to find workers that needed jobs
799.36 | and businesses that needed staff at the
801.76 | exact time in order to match them up but
803.68 | instead of getting bogged down with
804.88 | building the perfect system they just
806.6 | threw everything they had at the problem
808.959 | essentially they were doing things that
810.639 | don't scale we did like just Guerilla
812.76 | like going into the warehousing district
814.279 | and going door too went out to all the
816.12 | warehouses we went like around fences to
818.56 | introduce ourselves to the managers
820.079 | trying to get a hold of potential
821.88 | decision makers of these companies and
823.8 | usually you do get into conversations or
826.279 | do start getting information whether
828.0 | they use temporary workers or not doing
830.16 | those customer interviews like talking
831.88 | to workers and we were like there's
833.6 | definitely something here like we should
835.44 | start building something and see you
837.199 | know what we can what we can find out we
838.839 | put something in front of the customer
839.88 | and see what they how they react to it
841.519 | so we like coded a prototype of like
843.24 | what the app could look like Mike and
844.8 | oay worked hard to build the first
846.72 | prototype they recruited the first
848.16 | workers off the street or through
849.44 | personal networks we would sit in the
851.279 | back of Ubers and just ask the Uber
852.88 | driver like hey would you actually be
854.199 | willing to work in a warehouse um so we
856.959 | so we started getting like a bit more
858.519 | density on the worker side we had about
860.04 | 10 workers that we had met we met some
861.839 | someone on the side of the street and so
863.36 | we approached him was like Hey like we
865.0 | have other opportunities on our platform
866.36 | if you're looking for work um he was
868.279 | interested we got him to download the
870.24 | app on the spot um and ended up having
872.759 | him work at our uh at our first business
875.199 | customer in the next week like I went
877.68 | and picked up the workers in my car and
880.32 | I was like let's go to the first shift
881.8 | together and then on the shift like we
883.68 | all made it we were all there together
885.759 | as a team making sure everything went
887.8 | well and then I ven modowe the workers
889.6 | after like it was very much like old
891.639 | school like that a true founder would do
893.6 | anything necessary to solve the problem
895.48 | even if it means getting their hands
896.68 | dirty their first Big Break came when
898.399 | they land landed a small company that
899.72 | had been on Shark Tank this one business
901.92 | which is actually one of our it's a very
903.8 | good business of ours it's called CR
905.56 | Essence so they build they basically
907.8 | like create Haitian hair care products
911.279 | and it's a man and his wife and they
913.24 | were on Shark Tank and the company
915.519 | needed to ship out products and some
917.56 | days were much busier than others so
919.759 | they often relied on temporary staffing
921.759 | agencies to fill in gaps oxa and I like
924.32 | we found their address online we showed
926.12 | up and the the gate was locked Bally
929.0 | broke into this place knocked on the
930.72 | door and like introduced our to the CEO
933.199 | and like we're like we're raders can you
934.68 | give us a shot the model worked the app
937.24 | worked workers were getting paid and
939.16 | companies were able to deliver products
940.68 | on time again Mike had succeeded in
942.759 | scaling his first big client but his
945.04 | next challenge would be even bigger
946.759 | scaling his own business and the first
949.079 | Milestone was making a million dollars
950.8 | in
952.44 | Revenue but that raise to the 1 million
955.839 | was basically pulling out like every
958.0 | stop f in like every event client that
960.92 | like needed help tracking them down like
962.759 | convincing them that we could handle
964.279 | more and more of their work and then
966.16 | also on top of that like just
967.72 | aggressively all hands on deck everyone
970.079 | like calling companies like everyone
972.079 | trying their hand at it us like
973.92 | upselling other clients but it was just
975.839 | like a blitz of like everyone sitting
977.44 | there being like all right like if you
979.0 | can talk to someone on the phone like
980.319 | you're going to pick up the phone and
981.279 | try to close deals the team worked hard
983.399 | coming up with Creative Solutions to
984.959 | problems as they arose so in the
986.68 | beginning we had no idea about the
988.04 | supply to dynamic between the workers
989.88 | and businesses if anything everyone was
992.24 | saying there was a labor shortage like
993.839 | wal Street Journal New York Times a
995.279 | labor shortage in America the US economy
997.839 | still has a massive labor shortage
1000.279 | workers are nowhere to be found and some
1002.48 | businesses are having trouble hiring
1004.199 | enough workers to reopen fully
1006.399 | interestingly even though the common
1007.88 | narrative in the news was that people
1009.56 | weren't returning to the labor force
1011.6 | Mike and his team saw something
1013.079 | different on the ground The Narrative
1014.959 | everywhere was that people didn't want
1016.279 | to work but there was a lot of lot of
1017.88 | stimulus up there uh that it wasn't
1020.48 | obvious that the worker acquisition was
1022.16 | going to be uh easy in reality we learn
1024.679 | very quickly that everyone wanted to
1026.76 | work they just wanted to work on their
1029.12 | own terms to give people opportunities
1031.24 | to earn money that's convenient that
1032.839 | notches their Geographic preferences and
1034.959 | their times they just you know flock and
1037.039 | so then it was just a question of can we
1038.559 | acquire businesses cuz the worker demand
1040.559 | was really there it wasn't that
1041.959 | Americans didn't want to work they just
1043.88 | wanted to work on their own terms
1045.64 | ultimately it was what economists call
1047.48 | the labor matching problem and we saw a
1049.72 | similar problem crop up after the 2008
1051.88 | financial crisis the 2008 crisis was
1054.44 | that part of it a lot of pieces to it
1056.36 | obviously but the labor market part was
1058.36 | that we had two sectors of the economy
1060.52 | construction and particularly and then
1063.0 | manufacturing that took a massive hit
1065.72 | and those workers had to figure out what
1067.52 | they should do next and a lot of them
1068.84 | sat on the sidelines they couldn't find
1070.919 | anything that that was attractive to
1072.64 | them it was a huge matching problem you
1075.52 | you're sitting in Las Vegas and you're
1076.88 | not sure whether that you're going to
1079.76 | have a job in a week a month six months
1081.52 | or a year and you kind of Hope it'll be
1082.76 | a week so you wait and you don't
1084.48 | relocate you don't move you don't
1085.84 | retrain you don't imagine realistically
1088.88 | that this entire industry that you spent
1090.799 | your life in is never going to come back
1093.84 | for a long time at least to the level it
1095.679 | was before and so you don't adjust and
1098.679 | that's that's a huge problem if Trava
1100.72 | could help people find new jobs that fit
1102.52 | their schedules their Lifestyles and
1104.48 | their economic needs they'd be able to
1106.76 | have a huge impact on people's Liv lives
1108.88 | and build a great business in the
1110.24 | process and this highlights Mike's
1112.559 | second key strategy when you find a
1114.88 | stagnant industry leverage technology to
1117.64 | deliver a 10x better solution and this
1119.84 | is where the trillion dollar figure
1121.2 | starts to look not that insane for
1123.88 | example right now there are 17 different
1126.159 | staffing companies making over $1
1127.84 | billion a year if they can consolidate
1130.159 | that and then expand internationally
1131.799 | they have a good chance of hitting that
1132.96 | number and they already have an
1134.64 | advantage the labor matching problem is
1136.44 | simply too complex to solve with
1138.0 | tradition Staffing phone Banks but
1140.039 | software can make life better for both
1141.919 | workers and the companies trying to hire
1143.76 | them so with tra you download the app
1145.559 | and you just start working it's a true
1147.36 | meritocratic system where anyone that
1149.64 | actually wants to go make a living for
1151.36 | thems and work hard there is a very low
1153.679 | barrier to entry workers on tra can
1155.799 | build a resume of skills establish
1157.48 | connections to other workers and
1159.2 | essentially prove that they can do a job
1161.0 | effectively part of what is broken in
1162.76 | the current system is there's no way to
1164.64 | actually represent the skills that you
1166.36 | have to employers so whether that's like
1168.919 | lifting heavy machinery or like even
1172.4 | tiny things like showing up on time none
1174.32 | of that is actually recorded anywhere so
1177.24 | there's no incentive to keep doing that
1179.52 | so it Trava being able to record that
1181.96 | actually incentivizes workers to to
1184.6 | start doing this this allows employers
1186.2 | to be more confident about who they're
1187.679 | hiring and make sure they have the right
1189.2 | number of people show up on a given day
1191.08 | through GE location tracking the
1192.679 | supervisor doesn't have to actually go
1194.6 | through this whole process of calling
1196.039 | the staffing agency wondering where the
1197.64 | workers are they also can know okay we
1200.28 | have 10 people here right now but then
1202.4 | five will be here in a little bit it's a
1204.679 | perfect situation for technology to
1206.4 | improve outcomes but building it wasn't
1208.72 | easy we had an interview wind up with a
1210.4 | mayor of Miami towards the beginning of
1212.32 | July so I was like all right we need a
1214.08 | race to get this product out there by
1216.919 | that interview so yeah we have something
1219.4 | ready so that when people are watching
1221.4 | the video locally they're like oh great
1223.28 | I can actually just go and download this
1225.08 | basically we had just received funding
1227.36 | and we had made the commitment that
1228.72 | we're going to build the rest of this
1229.799 | app in the spin of a month that's not
1232.4 | something you hear normally building an
1233.96 | entire app isn't something that usually
1235.88 | can just be thrown together in a month
1237.64 | and so then it was like a scramble of
1239.84 | like okay the next four weeks you need
1241.0 | to build out this app to be completely
1242.559 | ready to go and in the stores and
1244.6 | usually the app in Play Store
1245.88 | submissions even takes like a week
1247.48 | sometimes like all right this things
1249.159 | been done in like 3ish three and a half
1251.2 | weeks about how it would kind of go is
1253.12 | like learning as I go and then like
1255.44 | during the day I'd like be working on
1258.159 | actual parts of whatever app we're
1259.919 | building or the website we're building
1261.12 | and that night I'd be watching different
1263.159 | videos I like tutorals and building like
1266.6 | a clean app in react and like good
1268.88 | practices and so uh I I solved on one of
1272.0 | our earliest engineer Morena where was
1274.039 | like okay we'll jump in we're building
1275.88 | all this stuff um and so we kind of just
1279.36 | like put our heads down and Crush
1281.32 | through it for that bling period of time
1283.279 | and so we had sat down and totally just
1285.679 | destroyed the app and pushed it out and
1288.4 | it was definitely a celebration at
1290.36 | release time but we didn't stop there we
1292.799 | actually did that and immediately
1295.36 | pivoted into now we have our worker app
1297.36 | out now we're going to turn around and
1299.32 | drop the business app in another month
1300.96 | to like a month and a half after months
1303.0 | of hard work and plenty of sleepless
1304.48 | nights improving tra's app they finally
1306.559 | hit their million-dollar Milestone this
1308.48 | set the company up for their series a
1310.44 | which came from Coastal Adventures we
1312.12 | ended up closing an amazing round um
1314.679 | Coast Ventures uh Samir was the the Leed
1317.88 | that there and so we got introduced to
1320.279 | to them through Keith Keith was
1321.76 | obviously at Costa previous to Founders
1324.08 | fund and um I was having an open store
1326.08 | board dinner actually with Samir and he
1328.0 | was complaining about the culture of
1329.559 | society in America where everybody's
1331.36 | entitled people of a certain age and
1333.279 | Below don't work very hard they don't
1335.4 | know what it means to build a company
1336.919 | blah blah blah and as he said this I was
1338.799 | like I've got the founder for you and so
1341.52 | I was like ring me m and they' actually
1345.32 | turned out they both grew up in uh
1347.039 | Northern Virginia it was kind of Love at
1348.96 | First side I think when Mike and Samir
1350.72 | met because Mike is Central Casting the
1353.0 | way people the way people built
1354.36 | companies startups in the 1970s 1980s
1356.96 | Mike has all that in his DNA on steroids
1359.12 | and Samir has watched for like 20 years
1361.72 | a really good VC company building and he
1364.32 | knows what it takes to win and as soon
1366.0 | as he met Mike he realized that like he
1368.159 | needed to invest see from day one Mike
1370.919 | had wanted to build a different kind of
1372.36 | company one where everyone worked
1374.4 | extremely hard toward a common goal
1376.32 | China Works 996 it's like very much part
1378.36 | of their culture as a result of that
1380.36 | they're really like they're surpassing a
1382.24 | ton of different competitors so it's
1383.72 | really hard to compete with the Chinese
1385.2 | company because if you're not working
1386.84 | like you know crazy hours then like the
1389.52 | company next to you is and they're going
1390.88 | to eat your lunch and so a lot of our
1393.44 | culture is like being in the office like
1395.6 | early and staying late and you'll see
1397.6 | that Mike is very much in the office
1399.6 | very early and then also staying very
1401.64 | late the concept of working 72 hours per
1404.0 | week can be controversial in some
1405.48 | circles but it really shouldn't be
1407.24 | joining a fast pay startup is optional
1409.2 | there are plenty of other companies that
1410.64 | don't work as hard but at tra they Pride
1413.44 | themselves on it that's one of the
1414.6 | things about hiring some amazing people
1416.36 | that they set standards they set the new
1419.6 | standard right and so like you hire
1421.08 | someone amazing they're Now setting an
1423.24 | example for everyone else as well and
1424.6 | it's like everyone who High performing
1426.4 | is a little bit competitive they want to
1428.44 | they want to achieve more they want to
1429.52 | learn more they want to be inspired and
1431.0 | so if they want to set the bar
1433.0 | themselves as well the magic of almost
1434.64 | every iconic company behind the scenes
1437.12 | the first 200 500 employees can tell you
1439.44 | the details every company that really
1441.2 | works has a certain kind of work ethic
1443.84 | and no compromises no excuses no
1446.2 | compromises and so they literally built
1448.0 | that very intentionally from the
1449.08 | beginning everything has been designed
1451.08 | around that after the social network
1452.919 | after all these things happened everyone
1454.2 | wants to join a startup because there's
1455.48 | lots of benefits with that but startups
1457.64 | are very very hard if you actually want
1459.48 | to win and we want to win we're playing
1461.08 | to win it most of the generational tech
1462.84 | companies we know today had extremely
1464.48 | intense work cultures at the start this
1466.399 | was exactly how Jeff Bezos thought about
1468.399 | building Amazon one of the people I
1470.679 | really like Thomas Edison here's a model
1472.72 | of his original light bulb he is famous
1476.0 | for saying one 1% inspiration 99%
1481.36 | perspiration it turns out ideas are the
1483.84 | easy part execution is everything it's
1486.0 | not for everyone but for people who want
1488.039 | to build something big and really love
1489.88 | what they do they wouldn't trade it for
1491.919 | anything and it was this intense work
1493.72 | ethic that carried the tra team through
1495.399 | hard times when they started expanding
1497.0 | things were going well in in Miami but
1498.559 | that's a small Market if tro was going
1500.48 | to have a real impact they needed to be
1502.279 | everywhere so the team identified Texas
1504.279 | as the next Market to expand
1507.159 | into Texas had a similar Staffing
1509.76 | problem to Florida and it was only a
1511.6 | short flight from the tra HQ in Miami
1514.08 | the next goal coming out of the series a
1515.72 | was okay we've proven the model here in
1517.6 | Miami we need to now take it out and
1519.32 | scale it in other locations and prove
1521.24 | that we can do this again and again so
1522.88 | when you're launching a new market you
1524.799 | don't have day on workers there is zero
1527.12 | establishment zero name recognition
1528.919 | especially when we launched our first
1530.2 | market like after Miami and so there
1533.6 | were things like starting off Austin you
1536.559 | know we didn't know going into it that
1538.24 | like the labor Supply would be a little
1540.159 | tighter than say DFW place where no
1542.48 | one's even heard of the brand right like
1544.6 | even by Miami standards we were still
1546.36 | small we're going to another state where
1548.2 | they definitely had never heard of us
1550.2 | was kind of going into where these
1552.559 | workers were already looking for jobs
1554.36 | and so obviously you learned some things
1555.919 | when you launched South Florida for the
1557.2 | first time there's a bit of trial and
1558.919 | error then when you go to Texas you hope
1560.72 | you've learned those you know from those
1562.2 | mistakes and you can smooth out some of
1564.279 | those trials and errors and do another
1565.52 | Mark and you hope you have a polished s
1566.919 | Playbook we have the Playbook we're
1568.679 | expanding across the country essentially
1570.88 | we're going to dominate every state that
1572.96 | we can like legally operate the way we
1575.0 | are operating in that's actually what's
1576.679 | happened a Trava they've been able to
1578.08 | add add layer cake layers of success
1580.64 | flawlessly and that's when you know you
1582.279 | have a formula that really works going
1584.039 | from a single Market Miami to a
1585.919 | multi-state business presented a bunch
1587.84 | of new challenges but it allowed them to
1590.039 | prove that the business model would
1593.039 | scale the most difficult year for early
1596.12 | stage companies in at least a decade
1598.52 | Venture Capital Loans all but
1600.679 | evaporating in Silicon Valley and that's
1602.44 | leading to more startup shutting down
1604.279 | even though the business metrics were
1605.52 | looking solid 2022 was an insane year in
1608.44 | Silicon Valley the NASDAQ dropped over
1610.72 | 30% and tons of startups went bankrupt
1613.52 | add to that a crowded market and you'd
1615.6 | expect tra to struggle but was able to
1618.12 | stand out from other startups by
1619.52 | doubling down on his core value of hard
1621.36 | work we dream big we're going for a
1623.44 | trillion we're going to make a company
1625.0 | that has a global impact that is massive
1627.399 | and it's going to take a lot of hard
1628.48 | work so like there's four values are
1630.08 | just Olympians work ethic growth mindset
1632.919 | customer Obsession and dream big and
1635.24 | everything we do is like about that when
1637.279 | you build a company where everyone's
1638.72 | aligned that doing something big is hard
1640.84 | work sweating the inputs really does
1642.48 | matter the faster you do things the
1644.0 | faster you grow the faster you grow the
1645.559 | less chance to is somewh else the fast
1647.24 | fall
1648.2 | so the culture here has always been
1650.24 | through pure work ethic Mike has
1652.64 | literally told me that our moat is hard
1654.76 | work and as simple as it sounds this is
1657.279 | his third key strategy Mike is just
1659.279 | committed to outworking the competition
1661.2 | and has built a team that agrees with
1662.88 | him completely his maniacal focus on
1664.88 | showing up and delivering results every
1666.6 | single day is What's led customers to
1668.96 | keep using the Trava platform to hire
1670.919 | people they know his team will get the
1672.84 | job done and it's also kept investors
1675.12 | committed to backing the company so you
1676.96 | know I found fun uh we like to double
1679.96 | down on the best companies in the
1681.399 | portfolio venture capital is a power law
1684.039 | everybody sort of knows that but most
1685.36 | people don't act on it fortunately
1687.039 | Founders fund over the years and over
1688.559 | the funds has been very strong at having
1690.64 | high conviction bats and really
1692.32 | investing more and more money in the
1693.72 | best companies so we were taking off a
1695.96 | new fund Founders fund 8 and we wanted
1698.32 | to lead the fund with a marquee
1699.84 | signature investment and uh the key GPS
1703.519 | at Founders Fund in the Venture side
1705.799 | Peter and Trey we're all you that tro is
1708.399 | the best from series a to the latest
1710.679 | financing we had proven that we can
1712.919 | launch multiple markets like we weren't
1715.039 | just a South Florida Miami company we
1717.799 | actually could expand nationally into a
1720.279 | bunch of different types of markets and
1722.519 | so we're super excited to lead the new
1724.2 | round and really Double Down um in the
1726.88 | company our commitment to the company um
1729.44 | our confidence in the company and then
1731.519 | the way that it came together is just
1732.919 | multiple board meetings of just like
1734.64 | consistent growth and like great unit
1736.919 | economic
1738.0 | great hires like the founders fund team
1740.76 | was in Miami so like Keith and Matias
1743.2 | and a bunch of the the folks who like
1744.799 | actually meet all the colleagues and
1746.12 | they they come by the office at like 10:
1747.679 | p.m. and be like this is crazy like the
1750.12 | energy in this office is like the olden
1752.2 | days at PayPal this isn't a sexy
1754.279 | industry most people don't ever think
1756.36 | about the workers whose job it is to
1758.2 | make Logistics centers run smoothly but
1760.72 | this is a vital part of the American
1762.279 | economy it's such a boring thing from
1764.24 | the outside looking in like you think
1766.159 | like oh the supply train like so
1768.24 | abstract like a lot of people fall
1770.559 | asleep at that like when you truly
1772.799 | understand it then that helps your
1774.48 | ability for like Business Development so
1776.64 | much cuz it's like everything you do is
1778.76 | impacted by it now like this is a place
1780.919 | that puts garlic into like jars so that
1783.72 | they can go to a grocery store so they
1785.159 | get shipments of garlic there's like
1787.36 | garlic like wrapped paper on the floor
1790.039 | everywhere smells like garlic and I'm
1792.279 | thinking to myself like this is this
1793.88 | hidden world that people don't know like
1796.48 | you eat a b bite of a chip little do you
1798.679 | know there was someone on like like a
