0.12 | rather than focusing on being more
1.839 | disciplined you need to focus on making
3.52 | better decisions on the small scale so
6.2 | that those condition
8.8 | yourself into adopting the identity that
12.12 | just does those things so there's two
14.12 | things there which is
18.6 | one this could end up being either the
21.4 | most boring or the most inspiring video
24.56 | that I've ever made and while I feel
27.039 | like there's a place for social media
29.32 | highlight re to show the accomplishments
31.92 | of others to be inspired in your own
35.0 | life I also feel like there is a lot of
37.68 | Merit in the boring day-to-day tasks
40.879 | that actually lead to the highlights in
43.719 | someone's life so in this video I just
45.96 | want to show you some of my actual life
48.68 | this is much different from my other
50.52 | videos maybe it will become a thing but
52.6 | I just want to show you my general
54.68 | morning routine I just showered I took
56.84 | the dog out I did all the normal stuff
58.84 | that normal people do but beyond that I
60.92 | also want to show a bit of my planning
64.04 | in the morning and a bit of my writing
66.6 | routine that has allowed me to build
69.159 | this life because that is one thing that
71.759 | seems very boring just when you look at
74.88 | the day-to-day grinding out 1,000 2,000
77.96 | 3,000 words and very few people see
81.04 | where that leads and they can't think
83.04 | long term to see how that pays off in
84.96 | the future now just for the sake of
87.24 | numbers because people are interested in
89.159 | that I've made mult multiple videos on
90.68 | this in the past but last year or two
93.04 | years ago I have a video where I made
95.439 | $800,000 writing 2 hours every day last
98.88 | year I was doing the same exact thing
101.36 | but I made 4.1
118.84 | million
129.8 | so to start things off I want to go over
133.16 | how I plan out my days because without
136.92 | this kind of routine to get in and
140.28 | having a daily habit that leads to
142.12 | long-term results that you can execute
144.36 | day after day after day if you don't
146.56 | have that then you can't expect much
149.319 | results from this now you don't have to
151.28 | be a writer to benefit from this routine
153.76 | but you do have to be an entrepreneur of
155.72 | sorts you do have to be attempting to
158.08 | gain full control over your income so
160.599 | you can be in full control of your life
162.68 | so for a lot of people This falls under
164.56 | creative work or Creator work creative
167.519 | work we think of design writing art Etc
171.48 | Creator work we think of
172.8 | self-improvement productivity Fitness
174.879 | Etc they're all relatively the same
176.8 | thing and you're going to have to do
178.68 | creative work in order to do Creator
180.36 | work I would argue that writing as a
182.08 | habit is something that every single
183.959 | person needs to do if they want to build
186.72 | a life of their own because one how else
188.959 | are you going to attract people that are
190.519 | going to pay you that's through media
193.0 | where is all of the attention right now
194.76 | it's not on the radio anymore it's not
196.4 | on the newspaper it's not on TV some of
198.76 | it is but it's all transitioning over to
201.48 | social media so that means you need to
203.44 | get on social media because that's where
205.239 | the attention is and without attention
207.72 | you're not getting attention on your
209.0 | work so you need to build an audience
211.28 | people still think that this is some
213.68 | kind of optional thing as if it's like a
216.599 | new internet job that people just fall
218.959 | into when in reality there's a reason
221.799 | why uh corporate companies are having
224.2 | their employees get on linked in and
226.12 | start posting there's a reason that was
228.12 | it P it's Tucker Carlson I'm not big
230.159 | into politics but he's going from
232.36 | mainstream media to just going full-time
234.68 | on his YouTube channel because he
236.319 | doesn't need them to survive anymore
237.92 | looping back to writing writing is the
240.56 | one thing that you do on a daily basis
242.48 | that builds an audience you write posts
244.2 | you write video scripts you write emails
245.959 | you write newsletters you write texts
247.599 | you write messages to your clients to
249.239 | your potential customers you send
250.68 | Outreach messages it's not as simple as
252.959 | just becoming a YouTuber and creating a
255.2 | video like this sometimes it is
257.16 | sometimes you get lucky but Marketing
259.479 | sales persuasion all of the things that
261.479 | make writing impactful are only going to
263.56 | benefit the videos that you create if
265.199 | you're not getting results in your
266.8 | videos or anything that you do it's
268.68 | usually because you lack persuasion and
270.4 | therefore you have lacked practicing
272.56 | persuasion with
274.85 | [Music]
283.639 | writing so the way that I like to build
286.52 | out my routine is separated within three
290.16 | time blocks these usually last 60 to 90
293.28 | minutes and they're separated by walks
295.759 | or making breakfast or food that's
298.4 | around like 9:00 a.m. and then going on
300.759 | more walks and then I end the day my
303.16 | work day by going to the gym so A Day in
305.84 | the Life For Me that we're going to go
307.32 | through is going to be composed of me
309.24 | going through that productivity routine
311.039 | me going to the gym and then maybe some
312.759 | stuff after to show you what I actually
314.16 | do but I usually just go on walks I
316.12 | chill out I eat dinner I talk to my
318.44 | friends I message business partners Etc
320.88 | so these three blocks that I lump my
323.319 | productivity stuff into you can do it in
325.8 | two different ways there's the build
328.12 | publish and maintain option where each
330.56 | of those time blocks is dedicated to
332.28 | build publish maintain if you don't have
334.199 | much time on your hands if you're
335.56 | working a job if you only have 1 hour
337.84 | then you have to fill that with building
340.12 | your first hour of your day has to be
341.96 | building something that can potentially
344.16 | be profitable enough to allow you to do
346.44 | it full-time so for a lot of people if
348.72 | we're going the social media route
350.12 | that's building a social media audience
351.919 | so that you can eventually monetize it
353.759 | building anything else a newsletter
356.36 | anything aside from writing social media
358.0 | content and getting very good at growing
360.16 | on social media is a waste of time aside
363.08 | from learning a skill and doing other
364.84 | things that you can monetize but that's
366.88 | main priority so for me in the build
369.16 | publish maintain I have building which
371.28 | I'm writing books now so that's my
374.039 | long-term project but in the past it was
376.88 | Building Products out digital products
379.039 | or my freelancing business and trying to
380.96 | land clients anything that moved the
383.16 | lever forward to my next phase of
385.08 | evolution in business now the publish
388.0 | block so 90 minutes a building go on a
391.08 | walk or do something and then the
393.319 | publish block is to publish to social
395.72 | media because that's how I split things
397.72 | up now where that's not a main priority
399.52 | just because it's automatic and then
401.68 | after that is the maintain block where
403.44 | I'm maintaining projects that I've built
405.12 | in the past that are earning me income
407.24 | so I'm talking things like the last book
409.599 | or certain courses or cortex or client
413.12 | work for cortex University or responding
416.12 | to emails managing finances going
418.72 | through the rest of my to-do list doing
420.599 | spillover tasks Etc the second way you
423.28 | can break this down into three different
424.919 | blocks is the long-term shortterm and
427.72 | immediate so the first block of your day
430.08 | is long-term this is usually if you're
431.879 | doing something full-time right this is
433.879 | your full-time thing so I'm writing the
435.84 | book and building cortex because those
437.44 | are very long-term projects they take a
439.599 | long time to build they take day after
441.72 | day for months and months and months
443.68 | until finally it launches and then I can
446.28 | move it to the short-term or the
448.56 | immediate and and fill something new
450.8 | with the long term because if you're not
452.24 | building something new always I've found
454.919 | that you get into this repetitive
456.96 | routine and you kind of put yourself in
459.039 | a second 9 to5 now the short-term block
461.52 | so after the longterm go on a walk the
464.159 | short-term block is for things that
467.36 | don't pay off immediately but pay off in
469.68 | the near future so a newsletter for me
472.4 | that turns into a YouTube video that's
473.96 | second priority that's what I write
475.52 | after the book and then the next is
477.759 | immediate so these are immediate things
479.8 | like in the maintenance category of the
481.84 | other way of doing it this is like
483.199 | responding to emails messaging people
485.479 | sending direct messages all of the
487.879 | little things that just check things off
491.72 | of your day they check the to-dos off of
493.68 | your
494.479 | day a lot of you are curious about my
497.52 | writing process so I want to give you a
499.72 | few things here I want to go over how I
501.72 | outline my newsletters and therefore my
504.36 | YouTube videos my other ones the ones
506.24 | that where I talk to the camera the ones
508.039 | that you guys know about and it'll also
510.08 | give you a sneak peek into the app we
512.44 | are building for writers and creators so
515.599 | this is a quick look into my writing
518.32 | process hopefully we can see this so the
520.959 | first thing that I do is I create an
523.919 | outline for the newsletter itself and
527.399 | therefore the YouTube video right so
529.12 | what I do is I brain dump ideas at the
531.519 | top and then I have connections so the
534.36 | notes or ideas or previous things that
536.72 | I've written that I want to reference
538.76 | and then research is where I'm not
541.16 | finished with this part yet but this is
542.72 | where I go through I ask chat GPT things
545.32 | I go through my previous content to see
547.16 | if there's any good ideas that I want to
549.64 | reference I research YouTube videos and
553.519 | medium articles to see what angles or
555.76 | ideas I want to include and then I start
558.64 | brainstorming hooks for the headline or
561.399 | the title of the newsletter video and
564.64 | this is like an ongoing process this
566.48 | isn't something that is finished right
567.92 | now it's at throughout the week today is
571.399 | uh Thursday I wrote the newsletter for
573.72 | this week already so this is for next
575.48 | week so I'm giving myself over a week to
579.8 | add to this outline as I'm writing the
582.24 | actual content and then I go through and
584.8 | I create just a soft outline for it and
587.36 | throughout this time I'm looking at the
589.079 | connections so I can open these in a
591.64 | side panel and read through and get
595.8 | ideas for what it is that I want to
597.959 | write about now when it's time to write
600.6 | this is when I create the actual
603.079 | document where I'm writing the
605.0 | newsletter and I use what we call cortex
607.279 | elements to start outlining it and I can
610.68 | get rid of these when I want to make it
612.76 | an actual newsletter so if I go to a
615.92 | previous newsletter like the last video
618.32 | or one of the previous videos this is
619.959 | what it looks like to actually write in
623.2 | CeX right so this is how I write the
625.64 | newsletters we have a lot of features
627.6 | planned So eventually you'll just be
628.88 | able to publish them but going through
631.76 | here I outline things I write it
634.04 | throughout the week and in the side
636.56 | panel I can just look at my outline and
639.44 | I can also open the connections to look
642.72 | at them here so just a quick sneak peek
646.04 | into what we're doing and my process for
648.6 | actually writing the newsletter itself
650.56 | hopefully that helps a tiny
655.03 | [Music]
658.24 | bit
672.84 | [Music]
686.58 | [Music]
688.24 | yo
700.23 | [Music]
713.99 | [Music]
718.16 | so at this point point in my day is when
720.399 | I eat breakfast after writing and before
723.079 | I go on a walk and while I eat breakfast
725.2 | that's while I knock out some tasks like
728.279 | checking into the community messaging
730.36 | people Etc just making sure I'm keeping
732.56 | on top of my day now you're probably
734.44 | wondering what I actually eat for
737.16 | breakfast and I have a very weird
740.36 | breakfast so here's my entire nutrition
743.079 | philosophy as well as I can put it so in
745.639 | the morning I have rice eggs spinach
750.88 | sardines and like coconut oil to
754.079 | actually cook it in now the reason
755.839 | behind that is I'm trying to knock out
759.12 | as much of my protein and micronutrient
762.48 | intake in the morning so I don't have to
764.92 | worry about it too much later as you can
766.76 | tell I frontload everything in the
768.56 | morning from my work to my nutrition to
771.079 | the gym Etc so that I don't have to
773.8 | worry about those things at night so I
777.56 | eat this because eggs are very
779.68 | nutrient-dense spinach Get Your Greens
782.199 | in sardines extremely nutrient-dense
784.6 | Omega-3s heart health blood pressure
786.639 | cholesterol Etc after I eat this I take
790.36 | my morning supplements which contain
792.399 | beef liver which is like Nature's multi
795.32 | vitamin it's just natural or desiccated
797.44 | beef liver what I try to do with this is
799.92 | I get in
801.72 | 50ish grams of protein with this I used
804.279 | to add cottage cheese with it but then I
807.12 | go to the gym I have lunch po
809.079 | potentially a protein shake and I'm 220
811.68 | lb so I'm trying to eat 220 g of protein
815.44 | by the end of the day so I'm trying to
817.24 | hit 150 plus by the time that I am done
820.839 | with the gym like when I eat after the
822.8 | gym I'm trying to get in as much protein
825.199 | so that later when I go to dinner I
827.839 | don't have to worry too much about like
830.32 | being it being the healthiest or the
832.079 | most micronutrient dense or having the
833.759 | most greens I still eat relatively
836.279 | healthy at dinner but when I do go out
838.32 | it's like okay like a bowl a good
840.519 | tasting Bowl don't worry about it too
842.199 | much cuz if it has chicken you're
843.6 | probably going to hit your protein goal
845.88 | etc etc so I'm going to eat this I'm
849.04 | going to check up on some stuff on my
851.399 | computer for work and then going to go
854.6 | on a
859.6 | walk I walk about 15,000 steps a day and
865.16 | on those walks I like to listen to
868.44 | audiobooks
869.639 | and YouTube lectures and just educate
872.279 | myself on things that I want to learn
874.519 | that can fuel my work or just make me a
877.44 | smarter individual I I feel like that is
879.48 | a lot more beneficial than not really
883.56 | doing anything or always working all the
885.72 | time so right now I am listening to the
888.32 | way of this superior man once again I
891.24 | listen to it often maybe once a year I
894.12 | highly recommend it for anyone looking
895.68 | to live a life of purpose now a common
899.079 | question that I get is Dan do you do
902.759 | anything like sauna or cold plunge or
906.24 | anything like that and the answer is no
909.0 | one because I just don't [ __ ] like
910.8 | those things they don't sound fun to me
912.72 | sauna isn't that fun cold plunge is just
914.839 | pure torture and I don't have the time
917.88 | to fill my routine with all of those
919.839 | things like I don't know how people get
921.6 | things done if they're doing cold Plunge
923.759 | in the morning run in the morning sauna
926.6 | sometime in the afternoon getting
928.04 | sunlight going on a walk doing a run
930.279 | doing whatever it doesn't matter I like
932.36 | to think from a big picture what is it
934.72 | that I'm trying to accomplish what is
936.12 | the ideal future that I'm leaning
937.639 | towards and to me I found that walking
940.88 | 10 to 15,000 steps a day going to the
943.56 | gym and doing cardio in exchange for one
946.72 | of my walks occasionally is how I
948.92 | achieve that I get sunlight which is
951.24 | absolutely necessary I would rather just
953.519 | sit in the Sun for the benefits of that
955.72 | rather than sit in a cold plunge or a
957.56 | sauna just makes more sense so if I can
959.92 | walk in the sun especially shirtless on
962.48 | the roof like I do later in the day or
965.24 | just shirtless around when it's sunny
966.68 | and I can get some form of a base tan
968.8 | that just makes more sense to me two
971.079 | well one not only am I generating ideas
973.48 | for my content am I thinking through
975.399 | ideas and using this as a part of my
977.92 | creative process I'm I would say that
979.68 | I'm technically working I would consider
981.48 | walks a part of my work and my life the
984.279 | second thing there is that walks that
986.639 | much walking Burns quite a few C
988.92 | calories so I'm not too worried about
990.68 | how much I eat well one I have to eat a
992.8 | lot I weigh a lot I go to the gym I'm
995.88 | trying to build muscle obviously and
997.839 | walking added on top of that makes it so
999.92 | I burn I would say my maintenance
1001.8 | calories are around 4,000 calories a day
1004.04 | so I have to eat 4,000 calories and I'm
1005.839 | allowed to do that so therefore I'm
1007.68 | allowed to have nice dinners with my
1009.519 | friends and family and loved ones
1012.639 | because I live this lifestyle early in
1014.92 | the morning I get my writing done I get
1016.519 | my work done I go on multiple walks I go
1018.68 | to the gym I fill my food in the morning
1022.319 | with micronutrient-dense foods and high
1024.64 | protein so that later in the day I can
1027.039 | live a normal lifestyle with the people
1029.24 | that live that lifestyle and it doesn't
1031.24 | take anything away in fact it actually
1033.0 | benefits my life because I'm not so
1034.88 | stressed and neurotic about going to the
1036.88 | cold plunge going to the sauna eating
1039.28 | extremely strict in the afternoon I'm
1041.88 | solely focused on doing what I need to
1044.559 | do in the morning and then doing what I
1046.559 | want to do in the afternoon there are
1049.799 | two C's to any good gym session
1054.0 | carbs and
1056.1 | [Music]
1059.28 | caffeine so I've seen a few Instagram
1062.44 | reels and such that talk about the most
1065.24 | natural pre-workout which is pretty much
1067.64 | just putting honey on your hand and
1069.799 | putting Himalayan sea salt on it and I
1072.64 | prefer to take the more synthetic
1074.12 | approach just like synthetic oil in a
1076.039 | car helps it run longer helps it run
1078.4 | faster maybe nobody really knows but
1081.919 | Rice Krispie treats fast digestible
1084.72 | carbs has salt makes for a good pump I
1088.28 | don't really care if I have a little
1090.039 | Rice Krispie
1091.6 | Treat tastes good second thing is
1094.24 | Monster Energy I drink these quite a bit
1096.52 | not necessarily monster but like ghost
1098.36 | energy or other things like that I only
1101.12 | get this because of the Nostalgia when I
1102.919 | used to watch Fitness people online this
1105.36 | is what they would get it's kind of on
1107.159 | brand with me black and white
1109.32 | it just looks good tastes pretty good
1110.96 | tastes kind of like an off
1117.08 | Sprite so it is about 1:30 right now I
1121.799 | just had a mastermind call with a few
1126.08 | students from the people I'm working
1129.159 | with and before that I I went on another
1132.24 | walk so so far today we have been
1134.96 | through my writing routine the
1138.799 | monstrosity that I eat for breakfast
1140.679 | including sardines babe what do you
1143.039 | think about sardines
1146.039 | disg she doesn't like that I make the
1149.64 | house stink and the morning of fish but
1153.72 | it's well worth it the Omega-3s
1156.2 | I'm you're big and it's called hell big
1158.559 | and strong yet so after the writing
1162.039 | routine after eating going on one walk
1164.799 | listening to an audiobook on that walk I
1166.559 | had a call with my book guy to disc
1168.679 | discuss like hard cover coming out other
1171.4 | things like
1172.44 | that did a bit more work went on another
1176.039 | walk this time it was like in the Sun so
1178.559 | getting my sunlight had the call at
1181.159 | 12:00 it's now 1:30 we're on our way to
1183.76 | the gym got my carbs got my
1186.52 | caffeine and yes we're going to train
1189.64 | arms and for those curious I do
1192.88 | train almost every day I like going to
1195.72 | the gym every day to keep a routine I
1198.799 | have rest days occasionally sometimes I
1200.76 | take like multiple rests throughout the
1202.6 | throughout the week but in general I
1204.28 | train every day I train four to six sets
1207.72 | per body part per workout and I do each
1211.159 | body part twice a week so that's 8 to 12
1213.48 | sets per week which is like on the lower
1216.0 | end of optimal volume but I go to
1217.76 | failure as much as humanly possible so
1220.84 | we're training arms today see in there I
1223.2 | haven't done this before excuse my
1224.76 | terrible vlogging
1227.64 | abilities
1231.22 | [Music]
1237.9 | [Music]
1249.68 | [Music]
1254.039 | so we just finished up at the gym uh my
1256.64 | workouts are usually like 4 45ish
1259.36 | minutes because since I go every day my
1262.039 | volume is split across those days and my
1265.64 | workouts aren't that long
1269.6 | but I wanted to go over what could be a
1272.279 | common theme for this video I'm
1273.64 | predicting the comments ahead of time
1276.2 | because I'm doing things that I normally
1278.4 | don't talk about in my videos like I'm
1280.919 | writing a lot like I normally don't show
1283.08 | these in my videos so I'm writing a lot
1284.679 | I went to the gym I went on walks so I
1287.4 | can assume that a common question will
1289.84 | be how do I develop that discipline or
1294.08 | how do you stay so disciplined and do
1296.36 | those things I want to reframe that a
1298.24 | bit where I don't think it's about
1300.559 | discipline I think it's about becoming
1303.24 | the person that automatically does those
1305.679 | things and they don't even have to think
1307.76 | about it it's just about cultivating an
1310.279 | identity and the actions that that
1312.679 | identity takes toward specific
1315.44 | goals lead to those actions and it leads
1318.0 | to you doing them without thought and
1319.679 | enjoying them so rather than focusing on
1322.76 | being more disciplined you need to focus
1324.36 | on making better decisions on the small
1326.559 | scale so that those condition yourself
1330.12 | into adopting the identity that just
1332.64 | does those things so there's two things
1334.72 | there which is one gaining perspective
1337.36 | there's perspective and there's
1338.799 | perception so you gain perspective of
1340.96 | your situation where you zoom out and
1343.679 | you think about the future that you
1345.159 | don't want and the future that you do
1346.72 | want and where your current actions are
1348.52 | are leading you so in terms of going to
1351.52 | the gym where do you not want to end up
1353.2 | in life fat
1355.76 | ugly feel like [ __ ] it's not a good life
1359.08 | where do you want to end up in life
1361.08 | jacked Rich tan happy makes sense you
1365.4 | can get more specific than that but then
1367.24 | in between now that you understand that
1369.88 | you have perspective now you need to
1371.76 | gain perception and bring Clarity to
1374.799 | your day-to-day actions so it becomes
1376.919 | easier to make better decisions you're
1379.0 | of course still going to make mistakes
1381.159 | and you're going to fall off track but
1383.72 | it's good to think of it on like an
1385.559 | averaging basis where over the average
1387.919 | of a year are you at least
1390.44 | 51% making good decisions if so you're
1393.88 | on track in terms of perception of your
1396.12 | current situation you need to hold your
1397.919 | perspective in the top of your head what
1399.679 | you don't want in life what you do want
1401.0 | in life and break that down into what
1405.08 | you need to learn and what you need to
1407.2 | practice so what you need to learn comes
1409.4 | from education like YouTube how did I
1411.039 | learn about going to the gym watching
1413.559 | people on YouTube studying their
1415.32 | techniques right you don't just learn
1417.679 | how to go to the gym you study someone's
1420.36 | program and then you try it out hm do I
1422.72 | like this do I not like this am I seeing
1425.159 | results you have to stick to it for a
1426.6 | decent amount of time to see progress
1429.0 | and feedback but then from then okay I
1432.08 | want to try something else you test
1433.6 | someone else's program this is not shiny
1435.76 | object syndrome this goes for business
1437.24 | too you don't just like fall into the
1440.32 | right business model you test a bunch of
1442.08 | different ones you fail at them and
1444.159 | eventually you learn the patterns and
1445.6 | principles that make it work so by
1447.2 | trying multiple training programs you
1449.36 | learn okay I need Progressive overload I
1451.44 | need a certain amount of volume per week
1453.48 | I need to get pretty close to failure I
1455.2 | need to train with enough frequency once
1459.12 | a week twice a week maybe three times a
1461.039 | week and you try them out you try out
1463.279 | different nutrition models you just
1464.76 | experiment with everything in your life
1466.44 | and eventually you're able to create
1467.76 | your own path toward the life that you
1469.919 | want and the way you filter out what's
1472.32 | useful and what's not useful for your
1474.039 | life that's perception you determine
1476.919 | whether or not it's leading to your
1478.2 | ideal future your perspective so
1481.279 | hopefully that
1482.48 | helps understand discipline and to not
1484.64 | think of it as discipline and just think
1486.279 | of it as compounding choices that lead
1489.0 | to the life you want so after the gym we
1491.88 | are going to protein house to get
1496.559 | protein and just a bowl of food like
1499.799 | decent calories I'm probably not going
1502.32 | to film anything later today I'm
1504.44 | probably going to go on more walks I'm
1506.159 | going to write a bit more it's
1507.559 | everything you've already seen it's just
1509.399 | split up throughout the day uh then
1512.6 | probably sit around go to dinner with
1515.799 | babe have a good time come home usually
1519.32 | we watch Netflix we've been watching
1521.76 | Lost and we've been meaning to try like
1524.279 | reading every night but we haven't
1525.679 | really done it just because lost is more
1528.6 | interesting than that is too good but
1531.159 | tonight we're gonna read or we're GNA do
1533.08 | something maybe go on a walk and just
1535.6 | have quality time together so I'll end
1538.44 | the video here cuz I'm sure you don't
1541.279 | want to see me just do the same thing
1542.6 | over and over again some people like
1544.0 | that I don't know leave a comment
1545.96 | letting me know what you thought of this
1547.679 | kind of
1549.52 | video bye
